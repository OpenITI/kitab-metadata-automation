90#BOOK#COMMENT##: Until 2001, there was not yet a full edition of the work
    (this overview of the editions is based on  Muḥammad bin ʿAbd Allāh al-Salloomi,
    The Missing and Unpublished Part of the Third Generation of the Ṣaḥābah,
    PhD thesis, Lampeter: University of Wales, 1996, pp. 67-68,
    https://repository.uwtsd.ac.uk/id/eprint/1029/1/503583.pdf)
    The earliest editions:
    * ed. Sachau et al., Leiden: Brill, 1904-1918. Not in the corpus
    * ed. n.n., Cairo: Dār al-Taḥrīr, 18 vols (based on the Sachau ed.;
    includes Arabic translation of the German indexes and notes).
    Not in the corpus
    * ed. Iḥsān ʿAbbās, Beirut: Dār Ṣādir, 8 vols. + 1 index volume
    (JK000530, Shamela0009351, Shia003044Vols):
    Based on the Sachau/Dār al-Taḥrīr ed.; includes only the indexes,
    not the notes, from the Sachau ed.
    All the above editions contain important gaps:
    * the third, fourth and fifth generation of the ṣaḥāba;
    * the tābiʿūn of Medina
    These gaps were later filled by partial editions based on new manuscripts:
    * al-Ṭabaqa al-thālitha min al-ṣaḥāba, ed. al-Sallūmī,
    PhD dissertation, Wales University (https://repository.uwtsd.ac.uk/id/eprint/1029/1/503583.pdf).
    Not in the corpus as such.
    * al-Ṭabaqa al-rābiʿa min al-ṣaḥāba, Ṭā'if
    (Shamela0012416)
    * al-Ṭabaqa al-khāmisa fī man qabaḍa rasūl Allāh, ed. al-Sulamī, Ṭā'if
    (Shamela0001689)
    * ed. Ziyād Manṣūr, Tābiʿī ahl al-Madīna, 1983
    (JK000744, Shamela009352, Shamela0007666)
    Some newer editions contain (some of) the missing parts:
    * ed. Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Qādir ʿAṭā, Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyya
    (Shamela0001686): adds the text of the Tābiʿī Ahl al-Madīna.
    * ed. Cairo: al-Khānjī, 2001: includes all missing parts

90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text appears to be quite clean; occasionally some
    extra elements that must have been added for structural clarity of the
    book; the text is structured quite well, but still takes time to sort
    things out; structure of the book - juzʾ > (group/settlement) > ṭabaqaŧ
    > tribe/clan; includes about 4,700 biographical records (another edition
    numbers ~5,500); some pages were missing --- identified with length
    outliers test and restored; some passages might still be missing.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 82355
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Removed the tags for Juz’. Subsections of the biographical tags replaced with #~:section:. Body text separated from the titles. Untagged headers tagged. Changes in the levelling of the headers made.

90#BOOK#COMMENT##: Until 2001, there was not yet a full edition of the work
    (this overview of the editions is based on  Muḥammad bin ʿAbd Allāh al-Salloomi,
    The Missing and Unpublished Part of the Third Generation of the Ṣaḥābah,
    PhD thesis, Lampeter: University of Wales, 1996, pp. 67-68,
    https://repository.uwtsd.ac.uk/id/eprint/1029/1/503583.pdf)
    The earliest editions:
    * ed. Sachau et al., Leiden: Brill, 1904-1918. Not in the corpus
    * ed. n.n., Cairo: Dār al-Taḥrīr, 18 vols (based on the Sachau ed.;
    includes Arabic translation of the German indexes and notes).
    Not in the corpus
    * ed. Iḥsān ʿAbbās, Beirut: Dār Ṣādir, 8 vols. + 1 index volume
    (JK000530, Shamela0009351, Shia003044Vols):
    Based on the Sachau/Dār al-Taḥrīr ed.; includes only the indexes,
    not the notes, from the Sachau ed.
    All the above editions contain important gaps:
    * the third, fourth and fifth generation of the ṣaḥāba;
    * the tābiʿūn of Medina
    These gaps were later filled by partial editions based on new manuscripts:
    * al-Ṭabaqa al-thālitha min al-ṣaḥāba, ed. al-Sallūmī,
    PhD dissertation, Wales University (https://repository.uwtsd.ac.uk/id/eprint/1029/1/503583.pdf).
    Not in the corpus as such.

90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- There are four names at the beginning of each
    chapter that do not include any information, but I have tagged them as
    ### $. This is because the information regarding these persons and their
    poems appears in the following pages. The author first names four poets
    at the beginning of each chapter and then presents some information
    about them in the rest of the chapter (sometimes in a disordered style
    and in combination with other information about poetry in general and
    …). I used this pattern for all chapters. Moreover, I have tagged the
    names of the poets in the beginning of each chapter (i.e. NOT inside the
    chapter at the beginning of their respective poems). There are two
    reasons for this: firstly, the names appear in complete form just in the
    beginning of each chapter. Inside the chapter they appear just in short
    form (i.e. without any Kunya and Nasab). Secondly, some of the names
    don’t have any explanation at all in the text and are just mentioned to
    complete the categorization. 2- Numbers 523-532 are lost in the text.
    But this is the problem of the book not Editpro version (As it is
    explained on page 522 of the PDF). 3- The book consists of two parts,
    but it seems to me that it is one volume (the page numbers are
    continuous both in the PDF and Editpro version). So, maybe it’s better
    to change the pagination.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 220, 326, 688,
    690, 697, 699, 713, 775, 1468, 1725, 1773, 2369, 2700, 3322, 3343, 3729, 3795,
    4279, 5419, 5505, 5531
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 2251, 5709

90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Most of the numbers explain about a specific person.
    Although some of such names do not appear at the beginning of the
    sentences, I tagged all of them as names (i.e. ### $) because the main
    theme of the book is to explain about these names and their reliability
    to quote Hadiths; but there are some other numbers that are not about
    one person. They might be about more than one person or may be just a
    hadith or some explanations. I untagged such numbers and tagged them as
    a simple paragraph, but with an asterisk (i.e. # *; so that they are
    distinguishable from other paragraphs). I am not entirely sure about
    tagging all the numbers correctly. So, the text needs to be reviewed by
    a specialist in Hadith literature (In addition, the text includes a lot
    of names that cannot be tagged structurally, since they are inside the
    lines).

90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The name of the publisher in METADATA is probably
    wrong. “مكتبة الرشد” has published this book, but by some other editors
    (not by the one mentioned here), and also in 16 volumes (not in 7). See
    this link: http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/85891404. 2- Some words are
    added in triple parenthesis (i.e. ((()))) into the text that do not
    exist in the PDF. In most cases, they are corrections; but sometimes
    they are strange and I didn’t understand what they really are.

90#VERS#COMMENT##: The link in VERS#LINKS that I have used for collation
    (and is exactly the same as the digital edition) leads you to a payment-
    based website and you must have an account to see the contents. 2- For
    several hours, I tried to understand which tribe is the descendant of
    which one and categorize the tribes according to their relations. It is
    really not possible. The categorization will go up until tenth-level
    headers and it will take inordinate amount of time to understand these
    relations. So, I tagged all tribes as parallel (second or third-level)
    headers. Only a specialist in the science of Ansab (genealogy) might be
    able to present a correct categorization of these tribes, and only after
    spending a huge amount of time.

90#VERS#COMMENT##: Digital edition is based on the edition by Waṣī Allāh
    b. Maḥmūd ʿAbbās and is of good quality. Individual hadith are ordered
    only by numbers which have been untagged  as headers but retained as
    paragraphs. Only volumes have been preserved as tagged headers. There is
    an anomaly in the numbering of these volumes (the "first" of the seventh
    volume comes between  volumes four and five) but this is consistent with
    the printed edition and the hadith numbering  continues uninterrupted.
    Digital file also includes an extensive editorial introduction  at the
    start.

    they are both based on  on the same edition by Waṣī Allāh  b. Maḥmūd
    ʿAbbās. Hadith are numbered but also grouped in thematic sections. Only
    the latter have been tagged. The sama'at from the manuscript  recorded
    on the last pages before the index (pp. 991-994) have not been included
    in the  typed version.

    version, with separate hadith  not already tagged. The title chosen for
    URI is debatable, the title as given on the edition is  "Min kalām al-
    imām ʿAbd Allāh Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal fī ʿilal al-ḥadīth wa-maʿrifat al-
    rijāl." There may be significant overlap with the text included in the
    corpus as 0241IbnHanbal.CilalWaMacrifa.

90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This version is not the exact same edition as the pdf
    but it's very closely related (probably a reprint). Pagination is a bit
    spotty (a lot of it is simply V00P00), but when it is actually noted it
    tends to correspond to the edtion. The digital text has a few extra
    headers which were useful in further subdividing this massive text (and
    they're broadly similar to other headings) so I have left them in the
    text. The digital text is of fairly high quality, but still includes
    some dirty data which should perhaps be cleaned up (footnote markers
    between brackets, dotted lines for pages with running footnotes but no
    body text). This version is not the primary version at the moment, I
    have raised an issue to make it so.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): The digital version is the same edition as the PDF.
    The difference in publishing year is because the publication of the book has
    lasted between 1995 and 2001. The first volumes of the PDF has 1995 as
    publishing year and the last ones has 2001, while the digital version just
    mentions 2001. 2- Third-level header tags was inserted after first-level
    headers. I changed them into second-level headers. 3- I deleted all editorial
    sections before each of the 45 volumes.

90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Shamela version is superior to JK version because it
    is much longer (though that includes editorial sections) and includes no
    pre-tagging of Qur'an verses. There are however some strange things
    happening with the Shamela text: it seems to be a combination of two
    different editions (it is unclear what the second edition is) but with
    bits of text missing and other parts inserted (especially subheaders). I
    have left these divergences mostly intact but restructured them where
    appropriate. Could not locate the right edition on Worldcat.
    PV removed the editorial sections.

90#VERS#COMMENT##: Deleted editorial introduction and table of contents. I have
    also deleted footnote markers but may have missed some. I tagged poetry. The
    text contains identifications of Quran verses (sura + verse number) between
    square brackets. I have left these in place. I have changed the commas in the
    text to Arabic commas. Text does not have a directly obvious structure, so I
    have left everything at first level. Beatrice Gruendler ("The Rice of the Arabic
    Book" p. 137) notes that the text has 114 chapters, but the present version only
    has 96.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 4672

90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The link in the VERS#LINKS leads you to a payment-
    based website and you probably don’t have access to it. I checked the
    text. The quality of reproduction is high (although I saw a few typos,
    especially in names). 2- The main theme of the text is to categorize the
    names that are similar in shape (like “خلیف” and “حلیف” or “عصبة” and
    “عصية”). I tagged all names as first-level headers since most of them
    are not just the name of one person but they refer to people from
    different tribes who have that name; and sometimes no name is mentioned
    at all, but there are just some explanations about the name. All the
    names need to be tagged separately, but I can’t do this because they are
    inside the lines and are not part of the structure of the text; so, they
    could not be tagged structurally. 3-It would be better if this text is
    reviewed by a specialist in Rijal literature. 4- Find a manuscript of
    the text here:

    "Abū al-Walīd Muḥammad b. ʿAbd Allāh b. Aḥmad al-Azraqī, a grandson
    of Abū Muḥammad al-Azraqī, reworked his grandfather's work about Mecca,
    including additional tranditions based on sources that mostly belong
    to the period after the creation of the original work. (...)
    Al-Azraqī's book Akhbār Makka al-Musharrafa belongs to the earliest
    works of this type, in which personal biographies did not yet become part
    of the historical geography. Basically, it is a real topography,
    in the real sense of the word, of Mecca and its surroundings.
    Al-Azraqī probably died around 250/865."

    chapter in Aristotle's text, the  three translations are given
    consecutively. The Graeco-Arabic project extracted each translation in a
